# Analytics Foundations
## Types of Variables
* Response / target / dependent / input / feature / attribute
* Predictor / factor / independent / output
* Numeric
  * Continuous
  * Discrete
* Categorical
  * Binary
  * Nominal
  * Ordinal
* Reference-level coding
* Effects coding
  * Useful when each level of a categorical variable has approximately equal sample sizes
  * Compare mean of each level vs. overall mean of the data
* One-hot encoding
  * `onehot` package in R
  * Faster than `model.matrix()`, and `dummyVars()` in `caret` package
  * Optimal scaling
    * Ordinal values need __NOT__ to be equally spaced levels
    * Requires a careful definition of a "1-unit" change between levels
  * Target level encoding
